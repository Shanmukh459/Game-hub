# Game Hub

## About the project

- This project is basically recreating the funcitonality and the look and feel of the [rawg](https://rawg.io/) website
- Experiemented with new UI library called [Chakra UI](https://v2.chakra-ui.com/) and it is really amazing to work with it.
- Created responsive UI layouts to fit different screen resolutions like Tablet, Mobile, Desktop.
- Users also has the ability to switch between dark and light themes
- Search feature is also implemented where users can search a game by its title
- The UI page contains multiple game cards which are fetched from Rawg API
- The games can be filtered based on the platform, genre
- The games can also be ordered by different metrics
- Card skeletons are implemented to enhance the User experience while the app is fetching the info from the API
- The title of the page will also be dynamically updated based on the filters applied.
